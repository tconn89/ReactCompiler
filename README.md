# ReactCompiler
So your designer friend is making a game in Twine story format Harlowe, but you're a web developer so no way are you getting near that Global scope pollutated nightmare.  Instead just write javascript  in React and compile to Harlowe

## Getting Started

`npm run build`

This reads all React components in `src/stories/` and eventually turns it into `src/index.tw`.
